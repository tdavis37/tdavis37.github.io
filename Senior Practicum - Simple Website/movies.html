			<p>5 Movies that made me love Cinema</p>

			<div class="row">
					<h2>1. The Equalizer</h2>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" 
					src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjctHUEmutw?si=6ItR8LbsWp5iXLM7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; 
					clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
				</iframe>
				<p style="font-size: 18px;" >The Equalizer is NOT your typical action flick. Denzel Washington portrays this ex-CIA operative, who is content to live a meticulously simple life until  
					a chance encounter with Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz), a teenager who has been manhandled by violent Russian mobsters, thrusts him back into the dangerous world he thought he had left behind.
					The Equalizer is a 2014 American vigilante action film directed by Antoine Fuqua, loosely based on the 1980s TV series of the same name. </p>

				<h2>2. I Can Do Bad By Myself</h2>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nkUvBCW-tS4?si=S3Ijgb7iUG29ZHoO" 
				title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p style="font-size: 18px;" >A good family movie with a plot that is easy to follow. April (Taraji P. Henson) is a heavy-drinking nightclub singer who lives off of her married boyfriend Raymond (Brian White).
				 Her stagnant life takes a sudden U-turn when her delinquent niece and nephews are caught stealing from Madea's (Tyler Perry) house and are brought to April to stay with her. It's one of Tyler Perry's better older movies that. I loved the realistc depiction of life with meaningful life lessons.  </p>

			<h2>3. The Social Dilemma</h2>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaaC57tcci0?si=y6uqW3lwPwBNVs6n"

		<p style="font-size: 18px;" >A documentary style film that explore the dangerous human impact of social networking. Social media platforms often use your interactions in order to promote things to you. This data and resulting analysis forms the basis for what you see in your news feed, impacting your thoughts, views and actions. It really opened my eyes and made me realize that it's important to consider the ethical implications that come as newer technologies arrise.</p>

		<h2>4. Rambo: Last Blood </h2>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4vWg5yJuWfs?si=5Rz_6seuLmnOD-XH" 
		title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<p style="font-size: 18px;" >At 73, most people prefer to sit at home, relax and reminisce their youth while being surrounded by their family. Clearly, Sylvester Stallone was not built that way. 
		Very similar to previous Rambo films, just on a smaller scale.</p>

	<h2>5. Last Holiday</h2>

<p style="font-size: 18px;" >Queen Latifah plays Georgia Byrd, a reserved sales clerk, and an amateur chef. Upon learning of a terminal illness, Georgia decides to sell all her possessions and live it up at a posh Central European hotel.
	 She really exudes charisma and warmth which creates this old feel-good formula. It's fun, it's charming, and it's cliché. </p>
