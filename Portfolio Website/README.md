# freecodecamp-html-css-portfolio
FreeCodeCamp assignment number two. After tackling the tribute page it is now time to work on a personal portfolio site. Instead of using codepen as instructed I have decided to code things on my own machine. The assignment has four user stories: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling. I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.  I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.), I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
